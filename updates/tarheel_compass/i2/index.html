This project has been a great experience for me I am incredibly proud of what I was able to create. I made this decision primarily due to the fact that I am graduating and do not wish to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project once I have left UNC.</p><p>I have decided to open source my data collection script so that anyone who would like to work with the registration data can collect it for themselves as they wish. The live version of the site will eventually be shut down and all data will be deleted.</p></div></main><footer>&copy; 2025 Fossinating.</footer></body></html>
