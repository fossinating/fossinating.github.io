summary: Explore a post-apocalyptic world while managing your hygiene
---
The apocalypse has struck! After a freak accident at the Amaze air freshener factory, zombies have risen and are hunting down bad smells. Explore and build in this new world, but be sure to watch your hygiene or risk being attacked by the zombies around you. If  you're getting too dirty, you can clean off in your nearest body of water, or you can escape the hordes by hiding in a flower field and letting the flowers mask your stench.
