Introducing Clear Recipes!

Clear Recipes is a revolutionary new recipe browser. Designed with dietary restrictions in mind, it makes it incredibly easy for people with dietary restrictions to find recipes that work for them. Search by title, allergen, diet, or a mix of all three to find just the right meal for you.



## Curent Features

- Recipe Search
    - Search through the recipes in the database by title, allergens, diets, or a mix of all three
- Upload Recipes
    - Upload your own recipes that you can privately search through later
