Introducing Chaindle!

Chaindle is a clone of popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/). In this version, players are given an infinite chain of target words, with each successful guess granting the player additional guesses and changing the target word.
